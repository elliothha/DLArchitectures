# DLArchitectures [In Progress]

(1/27/24 update) Currently working on implementing example architectures for:
- Coupling & Autoregressive Normalizing Flow architectures (NICE - Dinh et al., 2015; GLOW - Kingma and Dhariwal, 2018)
- Parallel WaveGAN for Image Modeling (Yamamoto et al., 2019)
- Markov Chain Monte Carlo algos (simple random walk Metropolis-Hasting; MALA)
- Gibbs Sampling from energy-based models

Plan to upload these finished example architectures when I have time to recover the notebook files from my old GPU:
- Categories in Computer Vision (Conv net architectures for object detection, etc.)
- Natural Language Processing (Text generation)
- Generative Models (Implicit & Explicit: GANs, RBMs, VAEs, etc.)
- Reinforcement Learning (Dueling Deep Q-Network model for Pacman!!!)
- Graphical Models (GCNs)
- Time Series Forecasting (LSTM)
- etc.
